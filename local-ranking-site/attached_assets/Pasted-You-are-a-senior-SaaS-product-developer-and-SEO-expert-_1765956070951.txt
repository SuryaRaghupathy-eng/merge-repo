You are a senior SaaS product developer and SEO expert.

I have an existing Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript SaaS marketing site.
I want to ADD ONE NEW FEATURE PAGE focused on my core differentiator:
Geo Grid Rank Tracking.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Early-stage SaaS
- No fake stats
- No testimonials
- No enterprise promises
- No Stripe yet
- The actual app already exists in a separate repo
- This page is for MARKETING + SEO only (not documentation)

PAGE TO CREATE:
/features/geo-grid-rank-tracking

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Local SEO agencies and SEO professionals (UK / global).

PRIMARY SEO INTENT:
- geo grid rank tracking
- google maps grid ranking
- local seo grid rank tracker

PAGE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):

1) PAGE H1 (ONE ONLY)
"Geo Grid Rank Tracking for Google Maps"

2) INTRODUCTION (PROBLEM FIRST)
- Explain why Google Maps rankings change by location
- Explain why single-location rank tracking is misleading
- Keep language simple and non-technical

3) WHAT IS GEO GRID RANK TRACKING
- Explain the concept in plain English
- Describe how rankings are checked from multiple points within an area
- No API mentions
- No technical jargon

4) HOW THIS TOOL SOLVES THE PROBLEM
- Explain at a high level:
  - Multiple location checks
  - Visual grid-style map output
  - Clear ranking visibility across an area
- Focus on clarity, not implementation

5) WHY THIS MATTERS (BENEFITS)
- Identify weak visibility areas
- Understand real local presence
- Prove local SEO performance
- Avoid false ranking assumptions

6) WHO THIS IS FOR
- Local SEO agencies
- Consultants managing multiple locations
- Businesses with physical service areas

7) SUPPORTING CAPABILITIES (SOFT FEATURES)
- Manual rank checks (trial-friendly)
- Historical rank comparison (previous vs current)
- Exportable reports (mention as capability, not guarantee)
- Scheduled checks can be mentioned as "available on paid plans"

8) VISUAL PLACEHOLDER
- Add a placeholder section for:
  "Geo Grid Visualization Example"
- Mention that a real screenshot will be added later

9) CTA SECTION (TRIAL-FIRST)
- CTA button: "Start Free Trial"
- Subtext: "No credit card required"
- Button should link to app signup URL (placeholder is fine)

SEO & STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Semantic HTML
- Clear H2 / H3 hierarchy
- Natural keyword usage
- No misleading claims
- No numbers or usage stats
- Written to rank AND convert

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean SaaS layout
- Professional tone
- No heavy animations
- Mobile responsive

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT mention Google Business Profile API
- Do NOT mention integrations not available
- Do NOT include pricing
- Do NOT include testimonials or logos
- Do NOT add other feature pages

DELIVERABLE:
- Full page content and structure
- Production-ready Next.js code
- Brief explanation of page intent and SEO strategy
