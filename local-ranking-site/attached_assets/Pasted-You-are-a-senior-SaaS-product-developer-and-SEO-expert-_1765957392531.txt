You are a senior SaaS product developer and SEO expert.

I have an existing Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript SaaS marketing site.
I want to ADD ONE NEW FEATURE PAGE focused on:
Google Maps Rank Tracking.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Early-stage SaaS
- No fake stats, testimonials, or big claims
- No Stripe yet
- The actual app already exists in a separate repo
- This page is for MARKETING + SEO (not documentation)
- Geo Grid Rank Tracking already has its own feature page

PAGE TO CREATE:
/features/google-maps-rank-tracking

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Local SEO agencies, SEO professionals, and consultants (UK / global).

PRIMARY SEO INTENT:
- google maps rank tracking
- google maps rank tracker
- local seo rank tracking
- google maps ranking tool

SECONDARY INTENT:
- Explain why Maps rankings differ from organic
- Introduce geo grid tracking as an advanced capability (link to existing page)

PAGE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):

1) PAGE H1 (ONE ONLY)
"Google Maps Rank Tracking for Local SEO"

2) INTRODUCTION (PROBLEM FIRST)
- Explain why Google Maps rankings are critical for local businesses
- Explain why Maps results behave differently from organic search
- Keep language simple and non-technical

3) HOW GOOGLE MAPS RANK TRACKING WORKS
- Explain tracking visibility in the local map pack
- Explain monitoring rankings for keywords and locations
- No API mentions
- No implementation details

4) LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL MAPS RANK TRACKING
- Explain single-location checks
- Explain why rankings can look stable but actually vary
- Set up the need for more accurate tracking

5) INTRODUCING GEO GRID VISIBILITY (INTERNAL LINK)
- Briefly explain geo grid rank tracking as a more accurate method
- Add a contextual internal link to:
  /features/geo-grid-rank-tracking
- Position geo grid as an advanced enhancement, not a replacement

6) WHY GOOGLE MAPS RANK TRACKING MATTERS
- Measure real local visibility
- Track progress of local SEO work
- Identify sudden drops or gains
- Support agency reporting and decision-making

7) WHO THIS IS FOR
- Local SEO agencies
- Consultants managing client locations
- Businesses relying on Google Maps visibility

8) SUPPORTING CAPABILITIES (SOFT FEATURES)
- Manual rank checks (trial-friendly)
- Rank history (previous vs current positions)
- Exportable reports (mention as capability)
- Scheduled checks can be mentioned as "available on paid plans"

9) VISUAL PLACEHOLDER
- Section titled:
  "Google Maps Ranking Overview Example"
- Note that a real screenshot will be added later

10) CTA SECTION (TRIAL-FIRST)
- CTA button text: "Start Free Trial"
- Subtext: "No credit card required"
- Button should link to app signup URL (placeholder is fine)

SEO & STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Semantic HTML
- Clear H1 > H2 > H3 hierarchy
- Natural keyword usage
- Educational, non-salesy tone
- No numbers, stats, or guarantees

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
