You are a senior SaaS product developer and SEO expert.

I already have a Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript SaaS marketing site.
I want to FIX and FINALISE my HOMEPAGE for an early-stage SaaS launch.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This is an early-stage SaaS (no fake stats, no testimonials, no big numbers)
- The actual app/tool already exists in a separate repo
- This site is ONLY for marketing and SEO
- Free trial is available (no Stripe yet)
- Target audience: Local SEO agencies and SEO professionals (UK / global)

Product positioning (DO NOT CHANGE):
"Google Maps Rank Tracking with Geo Grid & Organic SEO Insights"

TASK:
Refactor and improve the HOMEPAGE ONLY.
Do NOT add new pages.
Do NOT redesign everything.
Focus on clarity, trust, and correct trial flow.

HOMEPAGE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):

1) HERO SECTION
- ONE H1 only (exact text below):
  Google Maps Rank Tracking with Geo Grid & Organic SEO Insights
- Clear subheading explaining the product in simple language
- Primary CTA button: "Start Free Trial"
- Secondary CTA: "View Features"
- Mention "No credit card required"

2) HOW IT WORKS SECTION
- Simple 3-step explanation:
  1. Add keywords and locations
  2. Track Google Maps & organic rankings
  3. Visualise performance with geo grids and reports
- Non-technical language
- Beginner friendly

3) CORE FEATURES OVERVIEW (SHORT)
- Google Maps Rank Tracking
- Geo Grid Rank Tracking
- Organic Rank Tracking
- Each feature should have:
  - Short title
  - 1–2 line explanation (benefit-focused)

4) FAQ SECTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
- REMOVE any fake stats or claims
- ADD 5–7 FAQs about Local SEO & Rank Tracking
- Questions should include:
  - Why Google Maps rankings change by location
  - What geo grid rank tracking is
  - Difference between Maps and organic rankings
  - Accuracy of local rank tracking
  - Who this tool is for
- Answers should be:
  - Honest
  - Educational
  - Not salesy
- FAQ content must be SEO-friendly
- Structure the section so FAQ schema can be added later

5) FINAL CTA SECTION
- Clear CTA to start free trial
- Button should link to existing app signup URL (placeholder is fine)
- Reinforce "No credit card required"
