You are a senior SaaS product developer and SEO expert.

I have an existing Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript SaaS marketing site.
I want to ADD ONE NEW FEATURE PAGE focused on:
Organic Rank Tracking.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- Early-stage SaaS
- No fake stats, testimonials, or guarantees
- No Stripe yet
- The actual tool already exists in a separate repo
- This page is for MARKETING + SEO, not documentation
- Google Maps Rank Tracking and Geo Grid Rank Tracking already have feature pages

PAGE TO CREATE:
/features/organic-rank-tracking

TARGET AUDIENCE:
SEO agencies, consultants, and professionals who manage both local and organic SEO.

PRIMARY SEO INTENT:
- organic rank tracking
- organic keyword rank tracking
- seo rank tracking tool
- keyword position tracking

SECONDARY INTENT:
- Position organic tracking as a complementary feature
- Reinforce value of tracking Maps + Organic together

PAGE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):

1) PAGE H1 (ONE ONLY)
"Organic Rank Tracking for SEO Professionals"

2) INTRODUCTION (CONTEXT FIRST)
- Explain why organic rankings are still critical for SEO
- Explain how organic search differs from Google Maps results
- Keep language simple and non-technical

3) HOW ORGANIC RANK TRACKING WORKS
- Explain tracking keyword positions in organic search results
- Mention desktop and mobile tracking at a high level
- No APIs, no technical details

4) WHY ORGANIC TRACKING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH
- Explain why organic rankings don’t reflect local pack visibility
- Set context for why Maps + Geo Grid tracking matter
- This should naturally support other feature pages

5) TRACK MAPS AND ORGANIC IN ONE PLACE (INTERNAL LINKS)
- Explain the benefit of viewing organic and Maps rankings together
- Add contextual internal links to:
  /features/google-maps-rank-tracking
  /features/geo-grid-rank-tracking
- Position this as a unified SEO workflow

6) WHY ORGANIC RANK TRACKING MATTERS
- Measure SEO progress over time
- Detect ranking drops and gains
- Support reporting and optimisation decisions
- Build long-term SEO visibility

7) WHO THIS IS FOR
- SEO agencies
- Consultants managing SEO campaigns
- Businesses investing in long-term organic growth

8) SUPPORTING CAPABILITIES (SOFT FEATURES)
- Manual rank checks (trial-friendly)
- Historical position tracking
- Exportable reports (mention as capability)
- Scheduled checks can be mentioned as "available on paid plans"

9) VISUAL PLACEHOLDER
- Section titled:
  "Organic Ranking Overview Example"
- Mention that a real dashboard screenshot will be added later

10) CTA SECTION (TRIAL-FIRST)
- CTA button text: "Start Free Trial"
- Subtext: "No credit card required"
- Button should link to app signup URL (placeholder is fine)

SEO & STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Semantic HTML
- Clean H1 > H2 > H3 hierarchy
- Natural keyword usage
- Educational, honest tone
- No numbers, usage stats, or promises

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

CONSTRAINTS:

DELIVERABLE:
